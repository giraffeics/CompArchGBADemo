# CompArchGBADemo
A simple game made as a demo for a presentation on the Gameboy Advance's architecture. Basketballs are thrown from the bottom-left of the screen, and the goal is to catch them by moving the hoop. You can move the hoop using the D-pad.

To play the demo for yourself, check under the "Releases" tab and download the latest ROM (Demo.gba). You will need either an emulator or some way to get the ROM onto a cartridge.
